## Description: 

Motivation: 

    Our group was tasked with making an app using 2 different APIs. We wanted to use the PokeAPI, as we all played Pokemon Go. We realized it would work well with the weather API, as certain Pokemon are stronger in certain weather conditions.

Languages used: 

    JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Other

## Installation: 

Needed for installation: 

    The user needs a web browser, we used Google Chrome and Firefox.

Steps to install this project: 

    The user must clone all files from the project repository, and open the index.html file in a web browser.
  
## Usage:

    Get Pokemon based on current weather. 
  
## Features: 

    When the user searches for their city, they will be presented with the current weather for that city and a roster of 10 Pokemon to choose from of 3 different types. The user can then choose 5 Pokemon to add to their roster, which will populate the second page and can be downloaded as a jpeg.

## Issues: 
  
    The weather API we used (AccuWeather) had a limit of 50 calls per day which we used pretty quickly each day. We also had a problem of working all at the same time so we were constantly working with different files, which made us run into a lot of issues when we were trying to submit the final product.

## Collaborators: 

    The GitHub usernames of my collaborators are: cruzma, ataghva, neeko and mallory.faria

## Credits:

    We used PokeAPI, AccuWeather, tailwind.css, vanillatilt.js, jQuery and Trello.
